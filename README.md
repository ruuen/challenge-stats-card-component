## My process

### Built with

- HTML / CSS
- SASS
- A BEM-like syntax for element class naming (first time trying this out)

### What I learned

I started this challenge with a mobile-first approach of building, and thankfully that has always turned out to make things much easier.

This was the first time I have attempted to use a CSS naming convention style like BEM, and my usage definitely isn't "to the book" here I am sure, but it was a nice experience compared to the usual struggle of finding appropriate class names.

I think that I could have improved this component by figuring out a way to avoid usage of media queries for responsiveness using Grid or some more advanced flexbox params. Even with this point, hopefully the solution wasn't that bad overall.

### Useful resources

[Josh Comeau's blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) is a treasure trove of random useful & beautiful CSS tricks which I have read a lot before starting this project.
[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) continues to always be a useful reference for any project.
